flatfile
========

A complete flat-file parsing solution flexible enough to handle structured or unstructured data.

Flatfile was created in less than a month under a strict deadline. At the time, existing flatfile parsing libraries did not offer scripting outside of the development environment.

This project uses Maven to manage builds and dependency management. The completed build includes OSGi metadata which allows Flatfile to be a first class citizen in many OSGi environments. Flatfile was designed with Fuse ESB in mind, but with small modifications could be deployed in any OSGi container.
